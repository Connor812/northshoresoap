                  When you walk through the screen door at North Shore SoapWorks the first thing you
                  notice is the wonderful smell and you look around for where it could be coming from. That's when
                  you realize that you have just entered a special place unlike anywhere you have ever been before.
                  The beautiful aroma is the combination of handmade artisan soaps laid out like fancy
                  cakes and pastries amongst flowers and cozy cottage decor. You experience a true
                  "harmony of the senses". What you don‚Äôt realize right away is that all this soap is made in the factory
                  on site behind the unassuming little door with a curtain.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Soap is not all there is at the store, Stephanie has a flare for items that are tastefully
                  unique at every glance. You can also browse for jewelry, clothing, home decor, baby & kids
                  goods and of course fresh cut flowers and plants. She even has introduced a pet care line made in-house.
                  The collection of thoughtfully curated items makes gift giving easy with beautifully packaged
                  products anyone would be happy to receive. Many of Stephanie‚Äôs customers keep
                  going back just to experience another "harmony of the senses".

                        Meet Stephanie Misner, the owner and operator of North Shore Soapworks. She and her husband Scott, were both born and raised in
                        beautiful Port Dover and just couldn‚Äôt think of raising their
                        family anywhere else! Stephanie has been lucky enough to have worked as
                        a dental hygienist in the community for over 30 years and
                        physically she was ready for change. Her new venture as
                        owner/operator at North Shore Soapworks has continued to allow
                        her to be surrounded with wonderful people while still promoting wellness and
                        health. She is still able to be creative which satisfies her
                        artistic side. The best part is that she can bring her dog,
                        Daisy to work with her every day!

                     <p>
                        Our dynamic and creative soap maker that has been here since day ONE! Most
                        days Trish can be found in our little soap factory, conjuring up
                        fresh new ideas for soaps and scents, and of course, keeping
                        your long time favourites well stocked. Before becoming a soap
                        maker, Trish was a Pharmacy Technician for 20 years, which in
                        turn has made her the most organized of our bunch by far. Aren't
                        we all so lucky she made the jump into soap making?! In her
                        spare time Trish enjoys cooking, spending time with family and
                        friends, and taking care of her beautiful home. Here at North
                        Shore Soapworks we are thankful for Trish every day as she keeps
                        us on task, keeps us fed and keeps our water glasses full!

                        The newest face at North Shore Soapworks.
                        Although her journey here has just begun, her history with
                        Stephanie goes back to day one. They are cousins and Steph played a
                        very large part in Sarah's childhood. The family vibe continues
                        through the entire staff as everyone has welcomed Sarah with open
                        arms. She have always loved people and all things that smell good
                        so whether she's out in the front or in the factory, she's in her
                        element!

                     <p>
                        Now that we‚Äôve got her back, Hayley can be found helping our
                        guests in the store, brewing up our signature lotions, salts,
                        and even dabbling in the soap making! Before stepping into her
                        position here, Hayley was an international flight attendant
                        which has provided her with the ability to seamlessly jump into
                        any role needed here and provide a high standard of
                        customer service. As a new mom, outside of the soap store Hayley
                        enjoys slow mornings with her daughter rediscovering all the
                        little things in life, spending time in nature, and renovating
                        their little home with her husband. Here at North Shore
                        Soapworks we are grateful for Hayley and the energy she brings.
                        She keeps us laughing, and she makes sure that our work playlists are spot on.

                        Rachelle is our "Jill of all trades". On any given day Rachelle
                        can be found organizing anything and everything because she is
                        slightly type A, in the best way possible. She‚Äôs hands-on in the
                        factory and she‚Äôs always refreshing the store with her detailed
                        merchandising skills. She‚Äôs curated our dreamy Insta-aesthetic
                        and sets the tone for each day with her inspirational quotes.
                        Outside the soap store you might run into Rachelle at Sayza üßòüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
                        She loves to spend time in her garden, playing sports, and going on
                        adventures with her sweet growing family. At North Shore
                        Soapworks we love Rachelle for keeping it neat and tidy, her
                        tid-bits of important information, and her passion for snacks.
