               <p>
                  In contrast, detergent soap, also referred to as synthetic or commercial soap, is formulated using synthetic surfactants and detergents derived from petroleum or plant-based sources. These ingredients are designed to create lather and effectively remove dirt, oil, and microbes from the skin's surface. Unlike glycerine soap, which relies on the saponification of natural fats, detergent soap does not require this chemical reaction. Instead, it is manufactured through a combination of synthetic chemicals, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), which have strong cleansing properties. Detergent soaps often produce a rich foam and are known for their thorough cleansing action, making them popular choices for handwashing and personal hygiene.

                     <h2>STEPHANIE MISENER</h2>
                     <p>I‚Äôm Stephanie Misner, the owner and operator of North Shore Soap Works . My husband, Scott and I were both born and raised in beautiful Port Dover and just couldn‚Äôt think of raising our family anywhere else! I have been lucky enough to have worked as a dental hygienist in the community for over 30 years and physically I was ready for change. My new venture as owner/operator at North Shore Soapworks has continued to allow me to be surrounded with wonderful people promoting wellness and health. I am also still able to be creative which satisfies my artistic side. and the best part is that I can bring my dog, Daisy to work with me every day! </p>

                     <p>Now that we‚Äôve got her back, Hayley can be found helping our guests in the store, brewing up our signature lotions, salts, and even dabbling in the soap making!

                        In her spare time Trish enjoys cooking, spending time with family and friends, and taking care of her beautiful home.
